# Pink-Tac-Toe

A program written in JavaScript to play tic-tac-toe.

It is played on a three by three game board. The first player has "X"s as tokens and the second player has "O"s. They take turns. In order to win, a player must place three tokens in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row.

### Specifications

### Work in progress
As soon as I have time, I will try and work on the following:
- fix the message announcing whose turn it is and who wins (it was showing before but now it is not)
- add the possibility to enter the players' names
