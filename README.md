# Pink-Tac-Toe

A program written in JavaScript to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

It is played on a three-by-three game board. The first player has "X"s as tokens and the second player has "O"s. They take turns. In order to win, a player must place three tokens in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row.

### Specifications
- The program shows a three-by-three board
- A player can place a token in an empty square
- The players take turns
- The program knows there is a winner when a player has placed three tokens in a row
- The victory is celebrated with a round of applause

### How to play the game and run the tests

- you can play when you open index.html in your browser

### Work in progress
As soon as I have time, I will try and work on the following:
- fix the message announcing whose turn it is and who wins (it was showing before but now it is not)
- add the possibility to enter the players' names
